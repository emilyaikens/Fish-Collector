# Fish Collector

## Description 
A full stack-app used to keep track of biological survey collections. Created to practice using Python, Django, and Postgres. Practicality is limited.

## Getting Started

* Link to app is currently unavailable due to changes with the heroku free service

* Instructions: login to get started. Users can input fish collections, collectors, and survey information.

## Project Hurdles 

* In many ways Django is an easier framework to work with than Node and Express, but it has many more secrets. The many out-of-the-box functionalities that come with Django, while convenient, can make bugs a little trickier to track down. Overall, I enjoy using this technology and look forward to using it more in the future and getting more familiar with its intricacies. 

* Dealing with the database migrations is a bit of a hassel in Django/Postgres. It is inconvenient to restructure the models and data once they have been created and migrated. 

## Icebox

* Make this app more functional. I built it more for the practice than anything else. I would like to revisit the models and create a site that could actually be used to log biological surveys or collections. This would involve restructuring some of the relationships as well.
