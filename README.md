# Django collect project

The lab for each Django lesson this unit is to repeat everything done in the lesson, except you'll "collect" something else, like Finches, and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever.

The final version of your "Finch Collector" project will be a deliverable.

Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should create it within your `~/code` folder and make it a repo in your personal GitHub account.
